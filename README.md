PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Apple Tree Disease 

From the Kaggle description: Apples are one of the most important temperate fruit crops in the world. Foliar (leaf) diseases pose a major threat to the overall productivity and quality of apple orchards. Current disease diagnosis based on human scouting is time-consuming and expensive, and although computer-vision based models have the promise to increase efficiency, the great variance in symptoms due to age of infected tissues, genetic variations, and light conditions within trees decreases the accuracy of detection.

In this project you will develop a model that can classify an image of a leaf to a particular set of disease categories. The provided dataset has about 19,000 hi-resolution images of appletree leafs, with 6 possible labels. As a tree can have multiple diseases at once, it is possible that an image gets multiple labels. The dataset is not balanced.

Difficulty 4: Large input images will make training your models slower, and therefore youâ€™ll need to plan ahead a bit more. Models in this project must support samples with multiple output labels. Class imbalance can make training a model difficult.
